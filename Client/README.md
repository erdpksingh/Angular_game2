## Synopsis

**COMBO RACER**

The game uses the open source game framework [Babylon](https://doc.babylonjs.com/).

The build process uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to bundle, transcode and obfuscate the code.

The test run process uses [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to start a local instance of the game at http://localhost:3000/.

## Folder structure
